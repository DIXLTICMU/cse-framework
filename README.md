The Configuration Space Exploration Framework, is a project to enable large-scale distributed experimentation. 

The CSE is built on top of the UIMA framework.

As an example of what can be achieved, we have run experiments on question answering that explore ~ 3000 
different configuration options. 
That experiment took 600 compute-hours, and was completed in about 25 wall-clock hours.
